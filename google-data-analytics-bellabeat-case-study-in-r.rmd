# Project brief

[Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/) is a company that develops smart wearable devices that empower women worldwide to better understand their bodies and make healthier lifestyle choices. Having grown rapidly since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat founder Urska Srsen believes there is strong potential to build on past success and become a major player in the smart device market. To help unlock new growth opportunities, the founder and her executive team would like to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices and make high-level recommendations to inform the wider Bellabeat marketing strategy for one of their products outlined below. 

Current Bellabeat tracker products:

  * Bellabeat app: Provides users with health data relating to activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, mindfulness habits
  * Leaf: A bracelet or necklace device that tracks activity, sleep and stress.
  * Time: A watch that tracks activity, sleep and stress. 
  * Spring: A water bottle that tracks daily water intake
  * Bellabeat membership: Access to personalised guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health & beauty and mindfulness

# Phase 1: Ask

  

## 1.1 Business task

Identify and analyse personal smart device usage trends/patterns that could potentially unlock growth opportunities for Bellabeat as well as inform the marketing strategy.


## 1.2 Project stakeholders

  * Primary: Co-founder Urska Srsen (CCO), Sando Mur (co-founder) & wider Bellabeat executive team 
  * Secondary: Bellabeat marketing analytics team 

    To support this analysis, it would be helpful to get the opportunity to speak to stakeholders or (if not possible) relevant subject matter experts such as (device) product managers to understand the following: 
  
      + Needs and expectations from the analysis i.e. define what they believe are high-level recommendations
      + Overview and vision for each of the Bellabeat products e.g. positioning in the marketplace versus competitors
      + Go-to-market strategy as well as product performance in the market to date
      + Existing Bellabeat customer and market intelligence i.e. behaviour, usage, feedback, market trends, known potential product growth opportunity spaces, known unknowns etc.


## 1.3 Key questions to guide the analysis

  * What are some trends in smart device usage?
  * How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
  * How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy



# Phase 2: Prepare

 

## 2.1 Check data source and credibility

A public dataset uploaded by [Fitabase](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit/download) on the Kaggle platform has been identified by the founder which they deemed suitable for this analysis. The dataset was generated by thirty eligible FitBit users who gave permission for access to their personal tracker data over a two month period in 2016. 

  * __Structure__:  
    In terms of the research study structure, it is worth noting the sample size (30) used is the bare minimum and perhaps a larger study would be required for a brand scaling for global market penetration. If warranted, additional data sources may be used or referenced later in the analysis documentation. 

  * __Data__:  
    There are a lot of unknowns regarding recruitment criteria, participant profile, age or gender, working status, health condition, location, FitBit devices used and features/technical capabilities etc. Also, one of the key questions of this project is to identify smart device usage trends. However, this may prove challenging without having data that captures daily context of use, user and device interaction i.e. usage behaviour before and (change) during the study. 
    Should it be assumed the user smart devices capture the health and fitness data automatically requiring little to no manual data entry. These questions can be raised with the relevant stakeholders for their direction. In the meantime, the available data will be explored for patterns to help identify potential opportunity spaces and inform the marketing strategy.

In summary, it would be wise to have reservations regarding the limitations and credibility of the external secondary public dataset and be cautious about any conclusions.



## 2.2 Install and load packages to set up environment

```{r, results='hide'}

# Install packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggcorrplot")
install.packages("ggpubr")
```

```{r, results='hide'}

# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(skimr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(ggpubr)
```

## 2.3 Upload and import dataset files

There are a total of 18 files in the dataset. Having previewed some of the files in Excel, some contain duplicate data or data that has been merged e.g. dailyCalories, dailyIntensities, dailyCalories and dailySteps data is also contained in dailyActivity.

```{r, results='hide'}

# Import and load dataset csv files
dailyActivity_merged <- read.csv("../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
heartrate_seconds_merged <- read.csv("../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
hourlyCalories_merged <- read.csv("../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
hourlyIntensities_merged <- read.csv("../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
hourlySteps_merged <- read.csv("../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged <- read.csv("../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv")
sleepDay_merged <- read.csv("../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weightLogInfo_merged <- read.csv("../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```


## 2.4 Understand how the data in each of the 8 files uploaded is organised and populated

Aside from formatting issues, the following items will be addressed:

  * Review of structure and class of variables
  * Identify # Unique IDs to indicate participation numbers and determine integrity of files and dataset as a whole
  * Duplicated data to identify duplicates that need to be removed
  * Blanks (NA) to indicate completeness of data captured across the 30 users



### 2.4.1 Review of structure and class of variables in the files uploaded

```{r}

head(dailyActivity_merged)
```

```{r}

str(dailyActivity_merged)
```

```{r}

head(heartrate_seconds_merged)
```

```{r}

str(heartrate_seconds_merged)
```

```{r}

head(hourlyCalories_merged)
```

```{r}

str(hourlyCalories_merged)
```

```{r}

head(hourlyIntensities_merged)
```

```{r}

str(hourlyIntensities_merged)
```

```{r}

head(hourlySteps_merged)
```

```{r}

str(hourlySteps_merged)
```

```{r}

head(minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged)
```

```{r}

str(minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged)
```

```{r}

head(sleepDay_merged)
```

```{r}

str(sleepDay_merged)
```

```{r}

head(weightLogInfo_merged)
```

```{r}

str(weightLogInfo_merged)
```
 
### 2.4.2 Key observations of dataset class and structure: 

Actions to be taken in Phase 3: Process

  * dailyActivity_merged:
    + ActivityDate column to be renamed to "Date" and reformatted by converting from character <chr> to yyyy-mm-dd date format
    + Remove LoggedActivitiesDistance column - unnecessary as duplicate data of TotalDistance
    + Rename columns ending in minutes
          
  * sleepDay_merged: 
    + SleepDay date column needs to be reformatted by converting from character <chr> to yyyy-mm-dd date-time format
    + Remove time from same date column as all 12.00am and not useful 
    + Rename column TotalMinutesAsleep e.g. TotalTimeAsleep
    + Add new column to calculate total time in bed not asleep. Current TotalTimeInBed includes Total 

  * weightLogInfo_merged:
    + Date column in weightLogInfo_merged needs to be reformatted by converting from character <chr> to yyyy-mm-dd date-time format
    + Separate date and time in Date column
  
  * hourlyCalories_merged:
    + ActivityHour needs to be renamed and reformatted by converting from character <chr> to yyyy-mm-dd date-time format
    + Separate date and time in Date column
              
  * hourlySteps_merged:
    + ActivityHour needs to be renamed and reformatted by converting from character <chr> to yyyy-mm-dd date-time format        
    + Separate date and time from date column



### 2.4.3 Identify no. unique IDs to indicate participation levels and determine data integrity 

```{r Count unique IDs (users/devices) in ID column of each dataset}

# Count unique IDs (users/devices) in ID column of each dataset
n_distinct(dailyActivity_merged$Id)
n_distinct(heartrate_seconds_merged$Id)
n_distinct(hourlyCalories_merged$Id)
n_distinct(hourlyIntensities_merged$Id)
n_distinct(hourlySteps_merged$Id)
n_distinct(minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged$Id)
n_distinct(sleepDay_merged$Id)
n_distinct(weightLogInfo_merged$Id)
```



### 2.4.4 Visualising unique user participation across the datasets

```{r  Create a dataframe to capture unique IDs across the datasets of interest }

# Create dataframe to capture unique IDs across the datasets of interest
Unique_ID_summary <- data.frame(Daily_Activity=n_distinct(dailyActivity_merged$Id), Heart_Rate=n_distinct(heartrate_seconds_merged$Id),Hourly_Calories=n_distinct(hourlyCalories_merged$Id), Hourly_Intensities=n_distinct(hourlyIntensities_merged$Id), Hourly_Steps=n_distinct(hourlySteps_merged$Id), Minute_Calories=n_distinct(minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged$Id), Sleep_Day=n_distinct(sleepDay_merged$Id), Weight_Log=n_distinct(weightLogInfo_merged$Id))

head(Unique_ID_summary)
```

To create a graph, we need to transpose Unique_ID_summary to long/narrow format & sort by descending order

```{r To create a graph, we need to transpose Unique_ID_summary to long/narrow format & sort by descending order }

# Transpose Unique_ID_summary to long/narrow format & sort by descending order
Unique_ID_summary1 <- pivot_longer(Unique_ID_summary, 1:8, names_to= "Dataset", values_to= "Unique_IDs") %>%
  arrange(-`Unique_IDs`)

print(Unique_ID_summary1)
```

```{r Visualise unique user participation across the datasets  }

# Visualise unique user participation across the datasets
Unique_ID_graph <- ggplot(Unique_ID_summary1, aes(x=reorder(Dataset, -Unique_IDs), y=Unique_IDs, fill=Dataset)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label=Unique_IDs), vjust=2, color="white", size=3.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=35, vjust=1, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title = "User research participation levels", subtitle = "No. of Unique ID's in the relevant datasets provided by   users", x = "Dataset")

print(Unique_ID_graph)
```



### 2.4.5 Observations of # unique IDs to indicate levels of participation in the research study
      
  * Despite having a sample size of 30 research participants, the majority of the 8 datasets have 33  distinct IDs. It is unlikely there is data coming from more than 30 participants and more likely that some of the 30 participants are using more than one FitBit device for the study. This seems to also be the assumption of discussions on the dataset in Kaggle.
  
  * Low unique IDs come from the following: heartrate_seconds (14), sleepDay (24) and weightLogInfo (8)
    + weightLogInfo appears to be a manual entry which may be a factor in low unique IDs. Not much insight can be made/relied on from weightLogInfo dataset but perhaps interesting to learn if motivation to manually log weight changed over time?
    + SleepDay has captured data from only 24 participants which falls below the minimum 30 sample size. 
    + Heartrate_Seconds has captured data from only 14 participants so any insight generated from this data can be overlooked as part of the analysis and final recommendations



### 2.4.6 Identify duplicated data that needs to be removed
    
```{r}
# Identify (count) duplicated data
sum(duplicated(dailyActivity_merged))
sum(duplicated(heartrate_seconds_merged))
sum(duplicated(hourlyCalories_merged))
sum(duplicated(hourlyIntensities_merged))
sum(duplicated(hourlySteps_merged))
sum(duplicated(minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged))
sum(duplicated(sleepDay_merged))
sum(duplicated(weightLogInfo_merged))
```

 

### 2.4.7 Observations from duplicate data analysis

  * sleepDay_merged: 
    + "Locate and remove the 3 duplicates



### 2.4.8 Identify blanks (is null/NA) and missing data in files to indicate completeness of data captured 

```{r}
# Identify blanks/NA values
sum(is.na(dailyActivity_merged))
sum(is.na(heartrate_seconds_merged)) 
sum(is.na(hourlyCalories_merged))
sum(is.na(hourlyIntensities_merged))
sum(is.na(hourlySteps_merged))
sum(is.na(minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged))
sum(is.na(sleepDay_merged))
sum(is.na(weightLogInfo_merged))
```



###   2.4.9 Observations from identifying blank (is Null) values

  * Insight from weightLogInfo_merged dataset can't really be relied on due to lack of (8)unique IDs.Looking at the dataset it is clear the 65 Null values from a total of 67 rows are located in the Fat column.



```{r Validate all 65 Null (empty/NA) values reside in the Fat column }
# Validate all 65 Null (empty/NA) values reside in the Fat column
sum(is.na(weightLogInfo_merged$Fat))
```

  * Looking at the tibble in weightLogInfo tibble 2.4.1 all 65 null values out of a total of 67 rows reside in the Fat column. This column will be discounted from any analysis.



# Phase 3: Process


## 3.1 Clean the data for analysis

Execute each observation cleaning action points from Phase 2 Prepare i.e. rename columns, reformat dates and times, remove duplicates and unnecessary or redundant data etc.

```{r Tidy up column names in dailyActivity_merged }
#  Tidy up column names in dailyActivity_merged
daily_Activity <- dailyActivity_merged %>% 
  rename(Date = ActivityDate, VeryActive = VeryActiveMinutes, ModeratelyActive = FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActive = LightlyActiveMinutes, Sedentary = SedentaryMinutes) %>%
  select(-c(TrackerDistance, LoggedActivitiesDistance))
  
head(daily_Activity)
```

```{r Change dailyActivity$Date column from char to date format }
# Change dailyActivity$Date column from char to date format
daily_Activity <- daily_Activity
  daily_Activity$Date <- mdy(daily_Activity$Date) 
  
head(daily_Activity)
```

```{r Tidy up column names, date formatting issues and add a column for TotalTimeNotAsleep in sleepDay_merged }
# Tidy up column names, date formatting issues and add a column for TotalTimeNotAsleep in sleepDay_merged
sleep_Day <- sleepDay_merged %>% 
  rename(Date = SleepDay, AsleepInBed = TotalMinutesAsleep) 
  sleep_Day$Date <- mdy_hms(sleep_Day$Date) 
  head(sleep_Day)
```  

```{r Add a column in sleep_Day for calculating time in bed not asleep }
# Add a column in sleep_Day for calculating time in bed not asleep
sleep_Day <- sleep_Day %>% 
  mutate(InBedNotAsleep = TotalTimeInBed - AsleepInBed) %>% 
  select(-c(TotalSleepRecords, TotalTimeInBed))
  
head(sleep_Day)
```

```{r Remove duplicates in sleep_Day and validate}
# Remove duplicates in sleep_Day and validate
sleep_Day_deduped <- sleep_Day[!duplicated(sleep_Day),] 
 
  sum(duplicated(sleep_Day_deduped))
```

```{r Reformat weightLogInfo_merged$Date column from char to Date format and remove columns deemed reduntant }
# Reformat weightLogInfo_merged$Date column from char to Date format and remove columns deemed reduntant
weightLogInfo <- weightLogInfo_merged
  weightLogInfo$Date <- mdy_hms(weightLogInfo$Date)
    
  head(weightLogInfo)
```

```{r Separate Date and Time in weightLogInfo_merged, results='hide'}
# Separate Date and Time in weightLogInfo_merged
weightLogInfo %>%   
 separate(Date, into = c("Date", "Time"), sep = " ") 
```
```{r}
head(weightLogInfo)
```


```{r Remove redundant columns, results='hide'}
# Remove redundant columns
weightLogInfo <- weightLogInfo %>% 
  select(-c(WeightPounds, Fat, IsManualReport, LogId))
```
```{r}
head(weightLogInfo)
```


```{r Rename and reformat heartrate_seconds_merged$Time column from char to Date format}
# Rename and reformat heartrate_seconds_merged$Time column from char to Date format
heartrate_seconds <- heartrate_seconds_merged %>% 
  rename(Date = Time)

  heartrate_seconds$Date <- mdy_hms(heartrate_seconds$Date)
  
  head(heartrate_seconds)
```


```{r Rename and reformat hourlyCalories_merged$ActivityHour column from char to Date format }
# Rename and reformat hourlyCalories_merged$ActivityHour column from char to Date format
hourlyCalories <- hourlyCalories_merged %>% 
  rename(Date = ActivityHour) 
  
hourlyCalories$Date <- mdy_hms(hourlyCalories$Date)

head(hourlyCalories)
 
```  

```{r  Separate date and time, results='hide'}
# Separate date and time
hourlyCalories %>% 
  separate(Date, into = c("Date", "Time"), sep = " ")

```
```{r}

```


```{r Rename and reformat hourlySteps_merged$ActivityHour column from char to Date Time format }
# Rename and reformat hourlySteps_merged$ActivityHour column from char to Date Time format
hourlySteps <- hourlySteps_merged %>% 
  rename(Date = ActivityHour)
  hourlySteps$Date <- mdy_hms(hourlySteps$Date)
  
  head(hourlySteps)
``` 


```{r  Merge hourlyCalories and hourlySteps using ID and date and time columns }
# Merge hourlyCalories and hourlySteps using ID and date and time columns
Hrly_CalSteps <- merge(hourlyCalories, hourlySteps, by = c("Id", "Date"), all = TRUE)

head(Hrly_CalSteps)

```

```{r Add Weekday column to HrlyCalSteps by day of week if required}
# Add Weekday column to HrlyCalSteps by day of week if required
Hrly_CalSteps$Weekday <- weekdays(Hrly_CalSteps$Date)

head(Hrly_CalSteps)

```

```{r  Separate Hrly_CalSteps Date and Time in hourlySteps}
# Separate Hrly_CalSteps Date and Time in hourlySteps
Hrly_CalSteps <- Hrly_CalSteps %>% 
  separate(Date, into = c("Date", "Time"), sep = " ")

head(Hrly_CalSteps)
```

```{r  Reformat Hrly_CalSteps$ID column class}
# Reformat Hrly_CalSteps$ID column class
Hrly_CalSteps$Id <- as.character(Hrly_CalSteps$Id)

head(Hrly_CalSteps)
```


# Phase 4: Analyse & Share

Reminder of questions to guide the analysis:

  * What are some trends in smart device usage?
  * How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
  * How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy


## 4.1 Summary statistics and analysis of user data

To get a better picture of the data, analysis will be initiated by compiling a 5 number summary of statistics around the activity, calories, sleep and weight data available.

```{r Summary statistics for Activity }
# Summary statistics for Activity
daily_Activity %>% 
  select(TotalSteps, TotalDistance, Calories, Sedentary, VeryActive, ModeratelyActive,LightlyActive) %>% 
  
  summary()
```

```{r Summary statistics for Sleep}
# Summary statistics for Sleep
sleep_Day_deduped %>% 
  select(AsleepInBed, InBedNotAsleep) %>% 
summary()
```

```{r Summary statistics for Weight }
# Summary statistics for Weight
weightLogInfo %>% 
  select(WeightKg, BMI,) %>%  

  summary()
```


### 4.1.1 Observations from summary statistics

  * For some reason a few of the variables are showing zero minimum values which is not really possible as humans burn calories all day even when sleeping. One potential reason is perhaps the NA values being captured are interpreted as zero (0) calories. Scanning quickly over the calorie data, there are some observations where the Calorie count for the day is extremely low e.g. For example, one user Id burned 52 Calories in a day having clocked only 13 Sedentary minutes. Another user burned 0 calories the same day they were sedentary for exactly 1440 minutes or 24 hours. So it is clear there are some errors in the data, both min and max values.
  
  * Aside from a couple, the mean and median of most variables appear to be close to one another suggesting the data for those variables aren't skewed. The Very Active variable is clearly skewed with a mean value of 21 minutes, significantly greater than the median value of 4 minutes. It is most likely that there are some Very Active user Ids skewing the average.
 
  * An average total steps per day of 7,638 was recorded by users. Compare this average to U.S. citizens who average 4,500 steps per day which includes 2,500 steps for just doing normal activities like going to the bathroom and walking around the office. Looking at the research statistics referenced below, this poses both positive and negative health benefits depending on the age profile of the women in the research participants and target customers for Bellabeat. 
  
  Note: [Research](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-many-steps-better-health) from Harvard Medical School found that older women who
  took 4,400 steps a day had a 41% lower risk of premature mortality than those taking 2,700 steps a day. Death rates declined with more steps taken each day
  until about 7,500 steps a day, when the benefit leveled off. For younger women, another
  [study](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0324-daily-step-count.html) tracked a representative sample of U.S. adults (men and women) aged over 40,
  taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality compared to taking 4,000 steps. This figure rises to 65% with 12,000
  steps.
  
  * On average, research participants burned 2,304 calories per day. Average adult woman expend roughly 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day versus 2,000 to 3,000 for adult men. 
  
  * Sedentary time averages at a staggering 991 minutes (16.5 hours) per day (24 hours). These results are concerning as according to research from [The British Heart Foundation](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/activity/sitting-down) states "adults of working age in England average about 9.5 hours per day of sedentary time. Between the ages of 65 and 74, sedentary time in both men and women increases to 10 hours per day or more. By age 75+, people are sedentary for 11 hours per day". 
  
  * 8 of 33 research participants (who submitted BMI data) on average have a BMI score of 25.19 which just about creeps into the overweight classification. A healthy weight scores 18.5-24.9. 
 
  * Average sleep time per night for research participants equates to one session of 419 minutes (7 hours). Sleep Experts recommend a 7-9 hour sleep for adults. 
  
  * Total activity time per day (Very active, Fairly active and Lightly active) averages at 227 minutes (just under 4 hours). It appears the majority of research participants spend more time engaging in lightly active exercise than Very or Fairl active exercise. 

  * The sum of sedentary, activity and sleep time averages total to 27.5 hours exceeding 24 hours. Are there overlaps or inaccuracies in the activity data? This is worth exploring in more detail.

  
  
## 4.2 Transform the data for analysis

A person's activity and behaviours can change depending on the commitments in a given day or or night, be it a weekday or a weekend day. Therefore, the analysis structure will explore both the daily and hourly data to identify emerging patterns. 



### 4.2.1   Transformation of daily data 

```{r   Merge daily sleep and activity data using ID and date columns.  }
# Merge daily sleep and activity data using ID and date columns
Activity_Sleep <- merge(daily_Activity, sleep_Day_deduped, by = c("Id", "Date"), all = TRUE) 

head(Activity_Sleep)
```

```{r Add in weekday column to support analysis of data by day of the week}
# Add in weekday column to support analysis of data by day of the week
Activity_Sleep$Weekday <- weekdays(Activity_Sleep$Date)

head(Activity_Sleep)
```

```{r Reposition Weekday column beside Date column and reformat Id to char}
# Reposition Weekday column beside Date column and reformat Id to char
Activity_Sleep <- relocate(Activity_Sleep, Weekday, .before = TotalSteps) 
Activity_Sleep$Id <- as.character(Activity_Sleep$Id)

head(Activity_Sleep)
```

```{r Select relevant columns to create a new dataset that will help perform analysis by activity type}
# Select relevant columns to create a new dataset that will help perform analysis by activity type
By_activity_type <- Activity_Sleep %>% 
    select(c(1:4, 10:13, 14:16)) 
    
head(By_activity_type)
```


```{r Reposition calories column}
# Reposition calories column
By_activity_type <- relocate(By_activity_type, Calories, .before = TotalSteps)

head(By_activity_type)
```

```{r Transpose select activity type columns to sit under one column ActivityType}
# Transpose select activity type columns to sit under one column ActivityType
By_activity_type1 <- pivot_longer(By_activity_type, 6:11, names_to= "ActivityType", values_to= "Minutes")
  
head(By_activity_type1)
```


```{r Create subset of complete cases (rows) omitting NA values & group by Id, Activity Type, Convert minutes to hrs }
# Create subset of complete cases (rows) omitting NA values & group by Id, Activity Type, Convert minutes to hrs
By_activity_type_means <- By_activity_type1[complete.cases(By_activity_type1), ] %>% 
  group_by(Id, ActivityType) %>% 
    summarise(Hours = round(mean(Minutes)/60, 1))

head(By_activity_type_means)
```


### 4.2.2   Analysis of daily data activity 

```{r Plot Activity by User Id graph including a horizontal line representing 24 hours}
# Plot Activity by User Id graph including a horizontal line representing 24 hours
ggplot(By_activity_type_means)+ 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = Id, y = Hours, fill = ActivityType)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 24, colour = "black", size=0.25) +
  annotate("text", x = 5, y = 23, label = "24hours") +
  labs(title = "Activity per user Id", x = "Users", subtitle = "Average activity levels over the research period") + 
  guides(x = "none")

```

```{r Plot facet of activity per user Id by Activity type}
# Plot facet of activity per user Id by Activity type
ggplot(By_activity_type_means)+ 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = Id, y = Hours, fill = ActivityType)) +
  facet_wrap(~ActivityType) +
  labs(title = "Activity per user Id by Activity Type", x = "Users", subtitle = "Average activity levels over the research period") + 
  guides(x = "none") + theme(legend.position="none")
```

It was observed in 4.1.1 that the sum of sedentary, activity and sleep time averages exceeded 24 hours and warranted further exploration. From the Activity per user Id by Activity Type graphs above it is also clear that a significant number (20) research participants or "user Ids" are clocking more than 24 hours of activity which is not possible. It appears that sleep data and sedentary data may overlap each other. With some users in the graph (e.g. user no. 33 on far right hand side) missing sleep data, it would suggest that the sleep or sedentary data captured is inaccurate.

Stripping out the sleep data and just showing intensity and sedentary data in the next graph below may provide better understanding of activity. 
 

```{r Omit sleep related columns from ActivityType }
# Omit sleep related columns from ActivityType
By_intensity_type <- pivot_longer(By_activity_type, 6:9, names_to= "ActivityType", values_to= "Minutes") %>% 
select(-c(AsleepInBed, InBedNotAsleep))
  
head(By_intensity_type)
```

```{r Create subset of complete cases & group by Id, Activity Type, Convert minutes to hr}

```

We can see from the Intensity per user Id graph above that on average most of a user's day (12 hours minimum) is spent in a sedentary position. It is still unclear what constitutes sedentary time. Despite stripping out time in bed and and time asleep, more than half of the users are clocking close to 24 hours of activity. The other half of users are clocking just over 15 hours of activity suggesting they are getting the needed eight or so hours of sleep per night. The data suggests there are still errors reading true sedentary time. It is possible some user devices are not distinguishing between the sleep and sedentary activity.

In terms of intensity activity, the data is still telling us users tend to spend a lot more time being lightly active than moderately active. Finding time to be very active seems to be a challenge or low on people's priorities i.e. from zero to a maximum of 2 hours per day.

```

Going back to the summary of statistics data in section 4.1.1, all research participants or users burned on average 2,304 calories per day. Adult women expend roughly 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day versus 2,000 to 3,000 for adult men. In the Calories per user Id graph above, 12 out of the 33 user Ids have a daily calorie burn/expenditure average that falls in the 2,000 to 3,000 adult male calorie window. The remaining 21 Ids (approx two thirds) users fall into the female adult calorie window. So if all user Ids are assumed to be adult female, over one third have a high calorie expenditure suggesting they are engaged in some form of healthy physical activity. Without access to gender profiles in the data, scope for analysis is limited. 

```{r Group data by weekday to explore Calorie expenditure, daily Steps, Distance by day and define user types}
# Group data by weekday to explore Calorie expenditure, daily Steps, Distance by day and define user types
Most_Active_Means <- Activity_Sleep %>% 
  group_by(Weekday) %>% 
  summarise(Calories = round(mean(Calories, na.rm = TRUE)),
     TotalSteps = round(mean(TotalSteps, na.rm = TRUE)),
     TotalDistance = round(mean(TotalDistance, na.rm = TRUE), 2))

# Re-order Weekday column sequence to days of the week starting with Monday
Most_Active_Means$Weekday <- factor(Most_Active_Means$Weekday, c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"))

```


```{r Plot Calorie expenditure by day }
# Plot Calorie expenditure by day
ggplot(Most_Active_Means) + 
 geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = Weekday, y = Calories), fill = "cornsilk4") +
labs(title = "Calorie expenditure by day", subtitle = "Comparing total weekday average daily calories burned over the research period")

```

It was worth exploring briefly Calorie expenditure by day and see if there were any patterns, particularly on weekend days. However, it appears there is marginal difference between the seven daily averages. 

It would still be interesting to next explore the correlation of step counts to calorie expenditure.

```{r Steps vs Calories correlation for all users }
#Steps vs Calories correlation for all users
ggplot(Activity_Sleep, aes(x = TotalSteps, y = Calories, colour = Id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "TotalSteps vs Calories", subtitle = "Correlation between TotalSteps and Calories for all user Ids") +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

The TotalSteps vs Calories plot depicts a positive trend upward from left to right for all user Ids i.e. there is a moderate positive linear association between the two variables TotalSteps and Calories for all user Ids. Generally, more calories are burned as the the number of steps activity increases. 

Next step would be to look at the relationship between user activity intensity and calories. 

```{r Correlation between different activities and calories }
# Correlation between different activities and calories
ggplot(Activity_Sleep, aes(x = VeryActive, y = Calories, colour = Id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +  #se = computes confidence interval. If FALSE, the default, missing values are removed with a warning
  labs(title = "VeryActive vs Calories", subtitle = "Correlation between engaging in VeryActive intensive activity (minutes) and Calories for all user Ids") +
  theme(legend.position="none")
  
```

The graph above shows a moderately positive linear correlation between VeryActive intensive minutes activities and Calories i.e. In general, as very active intensity activities minutes increases, so does calories burned. To support this statement, we can also see the difference in correlations across the various (intensity) activities in the tables and correlation matrix below. When it comes to correlation coefficient values between IntenseActivity and Calories, VeryActive value (0.6) is much greater than ModeratelyActive (0.2) and LightlyActive (0.1).  

Interestingly, looking at the correlation coefficient results there appears to be a lower (0.4) positive correlation between Calories and Steps than VeryActive intensive minutes activities and Calories (0.6). A stronger relationship between the two variables suggests when it comes to burning calories, intensity of exercise in general trumps number of steps. The correlation coefficient result between Total Distance and Calories is 0.5. which may also suggest intensity of exercise in general trumps distance too. 

This is perhaps one of many reasons why HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) is changing the way people workout. According to [Tom Cowan](https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/hiit-is-changing-the-way-we-workout-heres-the-science-why-it-works/) a respected exercise physiologist from the Centre for Human Health and Performance London, _"excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, which is more pronounced with HIIT than continuous exercise, burns a further 6 to 15 per cent more calories as your body replenishes itself"_.

```{r Correlations between various activities and calories }
# Correlations between various activities and calories
Activity_Corr <- round(cor(Activity_Sleep[ , 4:16], use = "na.or.complete"), 1)

print(Activity_Corr)
```

```{r Plot a correlation matrix for Activities}
# Plot a correlation matrix for Activities
ggcorrplot(Activity_Corr, hc.order = TRUE, #organises variable by hierarchical clustering/order
          method = "circle", type = "upper", #  gets upper triangle on top half for readability
          title = "Correlation matrix of daily activity data",
          lab = TRUE, lab_size = 2.5)
```

Note the strong negative correlation coefficient results (-0.6) between minutes sleeping "AsleepInBed" and Sedentary minutes. Depicted in the graph below; in general as the sedentary time increases, the time asleep in bed decreases. This insight is particularly important when it comes to a person's health. Lack of enough sleep puts a person at risk from serious medical conditions including obesity, heart disease and diabetes. It is also said to shorten one's life expectancy.      

```{r Correlation between Sedentary activity and AsleepInBed, warning=FALSE}
# Correlation between Sedentary activity and AsleepInBed
ggplot(Activity_Sleep, aes(x = Sedentary, y = AsleepInBed, colour = "Orchid1")) +
  geom_point() +

  labs(title = "Sedentary (Minutes) vs AsleepInBed (Minutes)", subtitle = "Correlation between sedentary activity and time asleep", x = "Sedentary Minutes", y = "Minutes Asleep") +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

Without any demographic data and background information on the research participants, it would be useful to be able to define types of users in the study. User activity would be the most reliable data from this dataset and step counts would be a good option to classify the users as they are the preferred metric for quantifying physical activity. Working to a step-per-day classification from [U.S. National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488109/), users from the dataset will fall into the following steps-per-day categories:   

  * <5000     = Sedentary lifestyle
  * 5000-7499 = Lightly active lifestyle  
  * 7500-9999 = Fairly active lifestlye
  * 10000+    = Very active lifestlye

  
  
```{r Classify users by TotalSteps }
# Classify users by average TotalSteps
Types_of_Users <- Activity_Sleep_Means %>% 
  mutate(UserType = case_when(
    Activity_Sleep_Means$TotalSteps < 5000 ~ "Sedentary",
    Activity_Sleep_Means$TotalSteps >= 5000 & Activity_Sleep_Means$TotalSteps < 7500 ~ "Lightly active",
    Activity_Sleep_Means$TotalSteps >= 7500 & Activity_Sleep_Means$TotalSteps < 10000 ~ "Fairly active",
    Activity_Sleep_Means$TotalSteps >= 10000 ~ "Very active"
  ))

head(Types_of_Users)
```

```{r Calculate percentage of user types }
# Calculate percentage of user types
Types_of_Users_Percent <- Types_of_Users %>% 
  group_by(UserType) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>% #calculate count of each user type
  mutate(TotalUsers= sum(Count)) %>% 
  mutate(CalcPercent = Count/TotalUsers) %>% 
  #mutate(Percent= round(Calc_Percent, digits = 2)) # using scales::percent instead
  mutate(Percent = scales::percent(CalcPercent))

head(Types_of_Users_Percent)
```

```{r Create a pie chart of user types, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}   
# Create a pie chart of user types
ggplot(Types_of_Users_Percent, aes(x ="", y = Percent, fill = UserType)) +
  geom_col(color="black") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(label = Percent),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.0, size = 18, face = "bold"))+
  ggtitle("Distribution of user types", subtitle = "via classifying users by total average step count")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("coral1", "cornsilk", "cyan", "chartreuse"))    

pie                                    
```

It appears in the User Type table and pie chart above that (33) user types are fairly distributed. A difference of only 2 users between largest and smallest user type.

Using step count, the preferred metric for quantifying physical activity has helped look at user activity from a different angle. Why? Because earlier in this document, analysis of intensive activity amongst the user sample indicated an inactive group of users. Further exploration of the data showed overlapping/ unreliable sedentary and sleep data which to a certain degree impacted confidence in the intensive activity data. So it is interesting to now learn through the lens of the step count metric that the slight majority (51.5%) of users are made up of fairly active user (average 7,500 - 10,000 steps daily average) and very active users (10,000+ steps daily average).

It has already been shown (i.e. TotalSteps vs Calories graph) the positive relationship between total steps and calories. The more steps taken, the more calories burned. Next is to explore Steps and Calorie expenditure by user type and further validate the positive relationship.

```{r Calories burned by User type }
# Calories burned by User type
Calories_UserType <- Types_of_Users %>% 
  group_by(UserType) %>% 
  summarise(Calories = round(mean(Calories, na.rm = TRUE)))
  
head(Calories_UserType)
```

```{r Average daily Calories burned by user type }
# Average daily Calories burned by user type
  ggplot(Calories_UserType) + 
geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = UserType, y = Calories, fill = "cornsilk4")) +
labs(title = "Average daily Calorie expenditure by user type", subtitle = "User types classified by daily average step count")+
  theme(legend.position="none")

```

It is clear from the graph above that the more active you are, the more calories you burn. In this case, the fairly and very active user types burn the most calories which comes as on surprise.


```{r Boxplot for Calories burned by user type }
# Boxplot for Calories burned by user type
ggplot(Types_of_Users, aes(UserType, Calories, fill = UserType)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme(legend.position="none") +
    labs(title="Calories burned by user type", subtitle = "User types classified by daily average step count", x=NULL) +
    theme(legend.position="none", text = element_text(size = 12),plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0))

```

A few observations of the Calories burned by user type box plot above:
  
  * The calorie box (IQR or middle 50%) for Sedentary user types just about overlaps with the Very active user types suggesting the groups are close to being quite different from each other. 
    
  * Looking at the median value (i.e. middle value) of both boxes, the median line in the Very active box lies outside of the Sedentary box. Again, indicating there is likely to be a difference between the two groups.
    
  * The Sedentary box including the whiskers appears much shorter in comparison to the other three user type box plots and implies the Sedentary data points are clustered around the centre (median) value and not very spread out. This is expected with limited activity there is not much room for variability either side of the median.
    
  * Very active box including whiskers has a much bigger spread and range. The box itself is more spread out than Sedentary box and has much more dispersed values.
    
  * With near matching maximum values, the minimum value of Calories in the Fairly active box plot is much greater than the Very active minimum value. This is surprising.
    
  * Fairly active box is skewed to the top so the values in the skewed section are more variable.


### 4.2.3   Analysis of hourly data activity

Now that we have a view of activity and behaviours from a daily perspective, it would be worth spending some time diving into behaviours by the hours to surface any patterns and trends. 


```{r Gather data to analyse and plot Calories and Steps by the hour }
# Gather data to analyse and plot Calories and Steps by the hour
Hrly_CalSteps_means <- select(Hrly_CalSteps, Id, Date, Weekday, Time, StepTotal, Calories) %>% 
  group_by(Time) %>% 
  summarise(Average_Hrly_Steps = round(mean(StepTotal, na.rm = TRUE)),
            Average_Hrly_Calories = round(mean(Calories, na.rm = TRUE)))

head(Hrly_CalSteps_means)

```


```{r Plot Hourly Steps in a 24 hour period  }
# Plot Hourly Steps in a 24 hour period
ggplot(Hrly_CalSteps_means) + 
geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = Time, y = Average_Hrly_Steps, fill = Average_Hrly_Steps)) +
labs(title = "Hourly Steps in a 24 hour period") +
scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red") + 
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

From the Hourly Steps in a 24 hour period graph it appears that users are on average most active with steps during the morning commute hours of 7-9am, lunch time hours of 12 noon-2pm and commute home hours of 5-7pm. These peak step activity times mirror the peak Hourly calories burned times in a 24 hour period in the graph below. In the daily data analysis earlier in the document, the TotalSteps vs Calories plot depicted a positive trend between the two variables. Generally, more calories are burned as the number of steps activity increases.


```{r Plot Hourly Calories burned in a 24 hour period  }
# Plot Hourly Calories burned in a 24 hour period 
ggplot(Hrly_CalSteps_means) + 
geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = Time, y = Average_Hrly_Calories, fill = Average_Hrly_Steps)) +
labs(title = "Hourly Calories burned in a 24 hour period") +
scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red") + 
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

# Phase 5: Act

Bellabeat is on a mission to empower women worldwide to better understand their bodies and make healthier lifestyle choices. Having completed the data analysis process of the FitBit research study dataset, outlined below are behavioural insights and high-level recommendations that can help unlock new growth opportunities for Bellabeat as well as inform their marketing strategy. 



## 5.1 Data limitations identified

As stated from the outset, there are concerns regarding the research study structure, the credibility of the chosen public FitBit dataset and its suitability for informing elements of Bellabeat's product growth strategy. 

  * There are gaps in knowledge relating to the structure of the research study relating to recruitment criteria, bias and potential fit for Bellabeat's target market. 
  
  * The minimal sample size of 30 is not favourable to a growth brand that has ambitions to build a global presence.
  
  * The key question of this project is to identify smart health and fitness wearable device usage trends. However, this proved challenging without having solid data such as demographics, health & wellness status, device type/ownership, user environment, user and human-device-interaction. 
  
  * There are concerns around the quality (accuracy) and completeness of the dataset e.g. sleep and sedentary data overlapping, zero values for calories burned, missing user data for some device features when the sample size is already at a minimum level  

**If not in place already, it is strongly recommended Bellabeat invest in developing their own customer and market intelligence assets by conducting their own primary research into their own customers and competitors.**



## 5.2 Insights and high-level recommendations

Despite the limitations in 5.1, the analysis identified the following insights relating to Bellabeat's core Leaf product focus areas of activity, sleep, mental health, stress and maintaining a healthy weight. 

**Insights and recommendations have been made with the Bellabeat Leaf and Bellabeat watch products in mind.** 



### 5.2.1 Optimising device feature usage:
  
Exploring the datasets for various feature usage threw up some interesting questions. It was observed that the sample of 30 users returned 33 unique device Id numbers in the data. Although no evidence, it is thought that a few users had more than one device/Id number. The analysis did show all 33 unique Ids used the (step, calories) activity tracker feature compared to 24 unique Ids for sleep tracking, 14 for heart rate tracking and 8 for weight tracking. 

Insights and recommendations for device usage:
  
  1. Users either don't always understand all the benefits of features available on their device or a particular feature doesn't appeal to them. 
    
**Recommend further research to explore the primary motivations for purchasing/using a fitness wearable device and the features expected and preferred. This can then feed into the product and marketing strategy e.g. customise your own feature set and post purchase support and onboarding strategies.** 
    
  2. Delivering strong UX design across an ecosystem of Bellabeat products can drive loyalty, referrals and network effects. 
Users are potentially having trouble setting up and onboarding the feature(s). This could relate to user experience design aspects of app and device user interface. It could be related to techical issues such as comfort/wearability, charging issues etc. 
Exceptional user experience design and usability is a key differentiator and source for competitive advantage for growing challenger/niche brands like Bellabeat. 
    
**Recommend review of the user experience and design by performing user usability testing of Bellabeat and a benchmark review of competitor products.**
    
  3. Minimising friction to perform manual data input tasks is key to developing new habits to capture important data.   
  Capturing sleep, activity and heart rate data is automated and does not require manual input from users. Weight and BMI data on the other hand requires intermittent manual input/logging by the user. Despite good intentions, this can wane over time (like the weight data) and users lose motivation and need prompts/reminders to stay motivated.  
    
**Recommend Bellabeat perform experiments with new design strategies that motivate and maintain interest in these type of manual tasks. Also, exploration around the feasibility of introducing new technologies to devices like voice and image AI to reduce friction could also be considered.** 



### 5.2.2 Feeling healthy and maintaining a healthy weight     

Engaging in activity such as exercise and balancing calorie intake and calorie burn is an important aspect of feeling healthy and maintaining a healthy weight.  
Diving deep into the data, a clear positive relationship was identified between step count and calories i.e. more calories are burned as the number of steps activity increases. Looking at the strengths of various relationships between different type of activities and calories, it was found that in general, intensity of exercise activity trumps both number of steps and distance covered.

**Recommend Bellabeat could include exploration into how it can introduce instense activity into the product offering. Noted in the analysis is how Higher Intensity Impact Training (HIIT) is changing the way people workout. Scientific evidence states HIIT training results in burning a further 6% to 15% more calories as one's body replenishes itself post-exercise. This bonus of up to 15% more calories burned could be marketed effectively to target users.**



### 5.2.3 Sleeping better

Average sleep time per night for 24 of the research participants who submitted data equated to one session of 419 minutes (7 hours). Sleep Experts recommend a 7-9 hour sleep for adults. This is a positive result as it is known that lack of enough sleep puts a person at risk from stress and serious medical conditions including obesity, heart disease and diabetes. It is also said to shorten one's life expectancy.

A key piece of insight from analysing the data came from the relationship between time asleep in bed and sedentary minutes. The data showed a strong negative correlation coefficient result of -0.6 i.e. Generally speaking, as the sedentary time increases, the time asleep in bed decreases and vice versa. 

**Recommend Bellabeat to identify strategies to gently interrupt extensive sedentary periods and encourage some form of activity. Equally, helping/prompting users to identify the optimal time to go to sleep and how to prepare for a good night of uninterrupted sleep.**



### 5.2.4 Improving mental health and managing stress

Any aerobic exercise is known to improve mood. While acting as a distraction to the day's worries and irritations, exercise also activates feel-good neurotransmitters known as endorphins. Finding time in the day for exercise can prove to be challenging. From analysing the average Hourly Steps users took in a 24 hour period, it appears that users were on average most active with steps during the morning commute hours of 7-9am, lunch time hours of 12 noon-2pm and commute home hours of 5-7pm. These peak step activity times mirror the peak Hourly calories burned times in a 24 hour period. 

**Recommend Bellabeat consider helping users to continue/begin the habit of exercising during these peak times around working hours. Now that a lot of employees are working from home a few days a week, it could be a great opportunity to be a leader in helping users make the most of the hours saved not commuting to work. Examples include connecting users to exercise groups of interest near home and/or introducing users to participate in feel-good community movements such as Plogging - the combination of jogging and picking up litter for a cleaner planet.**       



### 5.2.5 Interpreting activity metrics could be challenging for users

It appeared initially in the data that most of a user's day (12 hours) was spent in a sedentary position and the remaining few hours left was spent being moderately active rather than engaging in more intense activity. Finding time to be active seemed to be a challenge or low on people's priorities. 

However, using step count, the preferred metric for quantifying physical activity has helped look at user activity from a different angle. Further exploration of the data showed overlapping/ unreliable sedentary and sleep data which to a certain degree impacted confidence in the intensive activity data. Through the lens of the step count metric it was found that the slight majority (51.5%) of users are made up of fairly active users (average 7,500 - 10,000 steps daily average) and very active users (10,000+ steps daily average).

**Recommend exploring Bellabeat target user understanding of the activity and step count metrics and how it can inform and shape their health and wellbeing.**



### 5.2.6 Other insights and recommendations

  * Platform/Device integration partnerships:  
  Further to the issue relating to friction users experience inputting data manually and incomplete data; **Bellabeat could attempt to avoid customers having to perform manual data input tasks by exploring potential platform integration partnerships with brands of popular devices such as weighing scales.**
    
  * Data accuracy:  
  Data accuracy seemed to be an issue in the study and perhaps Bellabeat could take note and reinforce Bellabeat's data accuracy and credibility as a brand. **Participating in (independent) reviews of health and fitness data accuracy across multiple competitor brands could perhaps provide good material for Bellabeat e.g. awards, press releases.**

  * User device interaction data:
  None of data captured in the study provide any insight into how users interacted with the device or the app e.g. How often a person charged the device and what time? What metrics and data visualisations did they look at most/least? What are the conversion rates on notifications/prompts/response to product feedback loops? There are lots more. 
  **Recommend Bellabeat initiate their own diary study in this area to uncover insights and unlock more growth opportunities.**
